A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This very simple project is the starting point of almost all mobile application
development and we will use that app as a starting application of Flutter App Development. 

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [All details about the flutter development](https://flutter.dev/docs)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

I created this app as starting my flutter development with Dr. Angela Yu
and want to share my experience with all of you.
